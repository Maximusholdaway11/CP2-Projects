# Updated Battle Simulator

## Project Description
---
This is a battle simulator with many features that allow you to manipulate characters that you create. You will be able to create characters, have them battle(with you playing as one of them), see a graph of each characters stats, and finally you can see data frames of the min, max, mean, and median of all the stats for each character(with a prompt asking if you want to see a graph of the values).  

## Installation
---
1. To install this program you need to import the files in the updated_battle_simulator folder.
2. Do not be concerned if a new folder called pycache appears as that is important for the program to run.   

## Execution and Usage
---

+ To run the program run the file named 'main'
+ To use any features other than create a character you first need to use the create a character feature.
+ The program will auto save all characters after every use of the character creator, battle sim, and will also save when you exit.
+ That is all hope you will enjoy using this!
