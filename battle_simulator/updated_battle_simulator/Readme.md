# Updated Battle Simulator

## Project Description
---
This is a battle simulator that allows you to create custom characters(with custom stats). You will be able to create characters, save and load them to a csv file, have them battle(with you playing as one of them), see a graph of each characters stats, see a data frame of the min, max, mean, and median of all the stats for each character(with a prompt asking if you want to see a graph of that),
