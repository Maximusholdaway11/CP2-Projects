# Coin Change Problem

## Project Description
---
This is Coin Change Problem solver which turns all amounts of any type of dollar and such into the amount of coins it would be.

## Installation
---
1. To install this program you need to import the files in the coin_change_problem folder.
2. Do not be concerned if a new folder called pycache appears as that is important for the program to run.   

## Execution and Usage
---

+ To run the program run the file named 'main'
+ To use any features other than create a character you first need to use the create a character feature.
+ The program will auto save all characters after every use of the character creator, battle sim, and will also save when you exit.
+ That is all hope you will enjoy using this!  

## Used Technologies
---

+ InquirerPy - Used for the custom user inputs that you will see. note: You need a python version of at least 3.7 or above to use this.
`pip3 install InquirerPy`
+ Pandas - Used for calculating the min, max, mean, and median of all the characters stats. note: This only officially supports python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
`pip install pandas`
+ Matplotlib - Used for creating all the graphs for the stats and/or min, max, mean, and median values.
`pip install matplotlib`
+ Faker - Used for generating the random character name as well as the character backstories and addresses. note: You need a python version of at least 3.8 or above to use the latest version of this.
`pip install Faker`
